      <div > <h3 class="attention">What is Attention Deficit?</h3>
        <p>According to DSM-5, defined as the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, the name of the syndrome is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Attention deficit disorder is not defined as a different disorder from this syndrome, but as a subtype of the same syndrome without hyperactivity. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) was not recognized as a disease for many years. However, today it is accepted that ADHD is a genetically transmitted, biological disease.
          Since attention deficit disorder alone was not defined as a disease in the past, many people with this disorder were branded as failures throughout their lives, had low academic achievements, were considered antisocial personalities, and were excluded from society. Today, criteria are determined according to DSM-5, which is defined as the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association and determines the criteria for diagnosing mental illnesses, and ADD is defined as a subtype of ADHD.
          ADHD is more common in boys during childhood. Ratios of 2:1 are stated in some series, and up to 6:1 in some series. As we approach adulthood, the incidence in women increases and the incidence rate is almost equal to that in men.</p>
